I am a third year undergraduate student from [College of Engineering](https://www.coe.pku.edu.cn/), Peking University. My research interest includes motion planning, optimization theory, multiagent system and reinforcement learning.

I am very fortunate to join [Autonomous Robots Lab](http://www2.coe.pku.edu.cn/faculty/liuchang/index.html) and be advised by [Prof.Liu](http://www2.coe.pku.edu.cn/faculty/liuchang/author/chang-liu-%E5%88%98%E7%95%85/index.html) since Dec, 2023. I have done a lot of research related to path planning of multiagent system using sampling-based method(dRRT*) and MPC. To improve its generalization, I am now trying to solve this problem by learning-based method.

You can find my CV here:

Most of my research focus on path planning of very-large-scale-multiagent system. In macroscopic stage, we describe the positions of robots using a time-varying pdf and in microscopic control, we use MPC to control the robots to follow the pdf. My algorithm can generate collision-free, energy-saving trajectories for hundreds and thousands of agents between their initial posions to target positions.Here are some of the snapshot of my simulation result. You can also [click here](https://github.com/QinghangLiu/QinghangLiu.github.io/blob/master/assets/tinywow_74e45d2ce8ffd2fc072c76c5c7fd8f1d_72691863%20(1).gif) to watch this video.

Now I am trying to design an RL algorithm to generate better pdf trajectories and make the algorithm more generalized. I have made some progress and I will continue this work. Click here to watch the full video!
