I am a third year undergraduate student from [College of Engineering](https://www.coe.pku.edu.cn/), Peking University. My research interest includes motion planning, optimization theory, multiagent system and reinforcement learning.

I am very fortunate to join [Autonomous Robots Lab](http://www2.coe.pku.edu.cn/faculty/liuchang/index.html) and be advised by [Prof.Liu](http://www2.coe.pku.edu.cn/faculty/liuchang/author/chang-liu-%E5%88%98%E7%95%85/index.html) since Dec, 2023. I have done a lot of research related to path planning of multiagent system using sampling-based method(dRRT*) and [MPC](https://github.com/QinghangLiu/QinghangLiu.github.io/blob/master/assets/tinywow_74e45d2ce8ffd2fc072c76c5c7fd8f1d_72691863%20(1).gif). To improve its generalization, I am now trying to solve this problem by learning-based method.

You can find my CV here:
